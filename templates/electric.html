        Time Series Analysis of Household Electric Power Consumption using
        ARIMA Model

        INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>Household electric power consumption constitutes the largest sector of
        U.S. primary energy consumption. As the rapid development and use of
        modern home appliances, consumers and businesses have the demand to
        understand the influence of home appliances on the household
        electricity power consumption. Motivated by both energy markets and
        environmental aspects, I proposed this project to analyze the time
        series data of historical household electricity power consumption and
        develop a best-fit forecasting model.

        OBJECTIVE
    </h2>
    <p>The objectives of project are to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>perform exploratory data analysis of household electricity power
            consumption;
        </li>
        <li>develop a model to forecast the daily household electricity power
            consumption;
        </li>
        <li>offered consultant service to customers and businesses.</li>
    </ol>

        DATA SOURCE
    </h2>
    <p>Individual household electric power consumption dataset is available in
        the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
    </p>
    <p>The dataset contains 2075259 measurements gathered between December 2006
        and November 2010 (47 months). The dataset has 9 variables:
    </p>
    <ol>

        <li>time in the format of hh:mm:ss</li>
        <li>global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power
            in kW
        </li>
        <li>global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive
            power in kW
        </li>
        <li>voltage: minute-averaged voltage in V</li>
        <li>global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current
            intensity in A
